== Dependencies

This extension is written against the SYCL 2020 revision 8 specification.  All
references below to the "core SYCL specification" or to section numbers in the
SYCL specification refer to that revision.

The following extensions are required only for dynamic allocations:

- link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_properties.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_properties]

- link:../experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_properties.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_kernel_properties]


== Status

This is a proposed extension specification, intended to gather community
feedback.  Interfaces defined in this specification may not be implemented yet
or may be in a preliminary state.  The specification itself may also change in
incompatible ways before it is finalized.  *Shipping software products should
not rely on APIs defined in this specification.*


== Overview

This extension adds 2 ways to allocate device local memory, without passing a
kernel argument: `work_group_static` and `get_dynamic_work_group_memory`.
Device local memory is memory that is shared by all work-items in a work-group.
The behavior is similar to the CUDA `+__shared__+` keyword, and the extension
draws some inspiration from the {cpp} `thread_local` keyword.

`work_group_static` variables can be allocated at namespace or block scope,
lifting many of the restrictions in the existing
link:../supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_local_memory.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_local_memory]
extension. Note, however, that `work_group_static` variables currently place
additional limits on the types that can be allocated, owing to differences in
constructor behavior.

`get_dynamic_work_group_memory` provides access to a dynamically sized buffer.

== Specification

=== Feature test macro

This extension provides a feature-test macro as described in the core SYCL
specification.  An implementation supporting this extension must predefine the
macro `SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_WORK_GROUP_SPECIFIC` to one of the values defined in the
table below.  Applications can test for the existence of this macro to
determine if the implementation supports this feature, or applications can test
the macro's value to determine which of the extension's features the
implementation supports.

|The APIs of this experimental extension are not versioned, so the
 feature-test macro always has this value.

=== `work_group_static` class template

The `work_group_static` class template provides storage of
an object into device local memory.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

template <typename T>
class work_group_static {
public:

  work_group_static() = default;
  work_group_static(const work_group_static&) = delete;
  work_group_static& operator=(const work_group_static&) = delete;

  operator T&() const noexcept;

  // Available only if: std::is_array_v<T> == false
  const work_group_static& operator=(const T& value) const noexcept;

  T* operator&() const noexcept;

private:
  T* ptr; // exposition only

};

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----

`T` must be trivially constructible and trivially destructible.

The storage for the object is allocated in device local memory before
calling the user's kernel lambda, and deallocated when all work-items
in the work-group have completed execution of the kernel.

SYCL implementations conforming to the full feature set treat
`work_group_static` similarly to the `thread_local` keyword, and when
a `work_group_static` object is declared at block scope it behaves
as if the `static` keyword was specified implicitly. SYCL implementations
conforming to the reduced feature set require the `static` keyword to be
specified explicitly.

[NOTE]
====
If a `work_group_static` object is declared at a block scope, the
device local memory associated with the object will be identical for all
usages of that function within the kernel. In cases where a function is called
multiple times, developers must take care to avoid race conditions (e.g., by
calling `group_barrier` before and after using the memory).
====

Change to SYCL 2020 section `5.9.2 Common address space deduction rules`:
Namespace scope: if the variable is `work_group_static` object,
then the variable is assigned to the local address space.
Otherwise normal rules applies.

SYCL 2020 requires that all global variables accessed by a device function are
`const` or `constexpr`. This extension lifts that restriction for
`work_group_static` variables.

When `T` is a class type or bounded array, the size of the allocation is known
at compile-time, and a SYCL implementation embeds the size of the allocation
directly within a kernel. Each instance of `work_group_static<T>` is associated
with a unique allocation in device local memory.

[source,c++]
----
operator T&() noexcept;
----
_Returns_: A reference to the object stored in the device local memory
associated with this instance of `work_group_static`.

[source,c++]
----
work_group_static<T>& operator=(const T& value) noexcept;
----
_Constraints_: Available only if `std::is_array_v<T>` is false.

_Effects_: Replaces the value referenced by `*ptr` with `value`.

_Returns_: A reference to this instance of `work_group_static`.

[source,c++]
----
T* operator&() noexcept;
----
_Returns_: A pointer to the device local memory associated with this
instance of `work_group_static` (i.e., `ptr`).

=== `get_dynamic_work_group_memory` function

The `get_dynamic_work_group_memory` function provides access
to a dynamically allocated buffer in the device local memory.

[source,c++]
----
template <typename T>
sycl::multi_ptr<T, access::address_space::local_space,
                           access::decorated::no>
get_dynamic_work_group_memory()
----
_Constraints_: `T` must be trivially constructible and trivially destructible.

_Returns_: A pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer
           in the device local memory.

The size of the allocation is unknown at compile-time,
and must be communicated to the SYCL implementation via the
`work_group_static_memory_size` property. Every call to
`get_dynamic_work_group_memory` returns the same allocation
in device local memory, regardless of `T`. For example, two call declared
as `get_dynamic_work_group_memory<int>` and
`get_dynamic_work_group_memory<float>` will be associated with the same shared allocation.

If the total amount of device local memory requested (i.e., the sum of
all memory requested by `local_accessor`, `group_local_memory`,
`group_local_memory_for_overwrite` and `work_group_static`) exceeds a device's
local memory capacity (as reported by `local_mem_size`) then the implementation
must throw a synchronous `exception` with the `errc::memory_allocation` error
code from the kernel invocation command (e.g. `parallel_for`).


==== Kernel properties

The `work_group_static_size` property must be passed to a kernel to determine
the run-time size of the device local memory allocation associated with
all `get_dynamic_work_group_memory` calls.

[source,c++]
----
namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental {

struct work_group_static_size {
  constexpr work_group_static_size(size_t bytes) : value(bytes) {}
  size_t value;
}; // work_group_static_size

using work_group_static_size_key = work_group_static_size;

template <> struct is_property_key<work_group_static_size_key> : std::true_type {};

} // namespace sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental
----

|===
|Property|Description

|`work_group_static_size`
|The `work_group_static_size` property describes the amount of dynamic
device local memory required by the kernel in bytes.

== Implementation notes

This non-normative section provides information about one possible
implementation of this extension.  It is not part of the specification of the
extension's API.

For class types and bounded arrays, the class can be implemented using
the WG scope attribute used by hierarchical implementation.
Note, however, that this requires to expose the attribute to the users.

For `get_dynamic_work_group_memory`,
and the implementation may need to generate some additional code to
appropriately initialize the pointer(s) returns by the call.
Alternatively, it may be possible to initialize the pointer to the beginning
of the device's local memory region (if that value is known). Either way, the
implementation must account for the existence of one or more `local_accessor`
objects (which themselves may allocate a dynamic amount of device local
memory).


== Issues

* We should clean up the wording regarding the scopes at which
  `work_group_static` variables may be declared.
  The current wording says they may be "allocated at global or function scope".
  However, "function scope" is not a {cpp} term.
  I assume we meant "block scope" here?
  I assume we also meant "namespace scope" instead of "global scope"?
  What about class scope or lambda scope?
  Are we intentionally omitting those, or is that an oversight?
  Are there any scopes where a `work_group_static` variable may not be declared?
  If not, we should just say that they may be allocated at any scope.
